POLYMORPHISM:

		poly     --> many
		morphism --> forms

	=>one entity showing different behaveiour at different place or state is called as polymorphism.

Polymorphism is two types:

	1.Complietime polymorphism.
	2.Runtime polymorphism.

	Complietime Polymorphism:
		
		=>Binding the method decleration to method definition by the Compiler at the Complie time based on the
			arguments is called as Complie Time Polymorphism.

		=>since binding is done before the execution it is called as early binding.

		=>Once the Binding is done it cannot be changed at the run time and hence it also called as static Binding

		=>Method Overloading is the best example of Complie Time Polymorphism.

	Runtime Polymorphism:
		
		=>Binding the method decleration to method definition by the Jvm at the Run time based on the
			OBjects is called as Runtime Polymorphism.
	    
		=>since binding is done during the execution it is called as late binding.

		=>Once the Binding is done it can be changed at the run time and hence it also called as Dynamic Binding.

		=>Method Overriding is the best example of Complie Time Polymorphism.

GOLDEN RULE OF JAVA:
		
		=> using Upcasted reference if you call an Overriden method then you always get the implimentation of subclass.
