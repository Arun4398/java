METHOD OVERLOADING:

	=>Developing multiple methods within the same class with the same name which may differ In
		->Number of arguments
		->Data type of arguments
		->Order of arguments
		is called method overloading.

	=>Two Overloaded Methods can have different
		->Access Modifiers.
		->Access Specifiers.
		->Return Type.

	  eg: println(); is the best example for method overloading.

Advantages:

	=>It is easy to remember one method which may perfrom similar operation with different arguments.

Disadvantages:

	=>If proper documentation are not maintained for every overloaded method, it will be diffcult for the 
		new developer to undtestand behaviours of every methods.


		eg:
			1.methodoverloadingMain.java
